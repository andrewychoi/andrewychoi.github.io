&lt;p&gt;Consumer goods startups, many of whom are direct-to-consumer, are really driving most of the growth in the overall consumer goods world. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2018/07/10/changing-consumer-behavior-has-pushed-cpg-giants-buying-binge-to-a-15-year-high/#2f37b6364944&quot;&gt;Forbes and OC&amp;amp;C Strategy Consultants’ annual Global 50 report&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, there were 60 M&amp;amp;A transactions from the world’s top 50 consumer goods companies, “the total value of [which] nearly tripled to $145 billion last year from 2016.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer goods startups are highly valued. How are they reaching their customers and establishing themselves as brands?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One factor seems to be a groundswell of social media, especially visually. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/10/9/17938356/facebook-instagram-future-revenue-growth-kevin-systrom&quot;&gt;According to Andy Hargreaves&lt;/a&gt;, a research analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets, Instagram is expected to grow “to about 30 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue in two years, as well as nearly 70 percent of the company’s new revenue by 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an observer on the ground in NYC, it seems that pop-up culture is taking over. A friend and I walked into a cosmetics store to find a new kind of lip balm (which, incidentally, she told me she had seen on Instagram) and we were almost immediately pitched the pop-up cosmetic “experience” in the rear of the store. As a cherry on top, it seems that a number of these pop-up locations are actually charging for admission–a brilliant move to kill two birds with one stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend is nothing new for many: from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16000552/instagram-restaurant-interior-design-photo-friendly-media-noche&quot;&gt;restaurants designed from the ground up to appeal to the phone camera&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2017/7/6/15925940/instagram-influencers-cronuts-milkshakes-burgers&quot;&gt;changing the actual kinds of food we buy (and not necessarily eat)&lt;/a&gt;, the culture is pervasive. For some, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/while-we-were-young&quot;&gt;counterculture&lt;/a&gt; is already here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Instagram is driving much of influencer and consumption culture, and there is an opportunity for brands to mobilize every visitor to their stores as an ambassador for their brand, why aren’t more brands taking advantage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief risk in running a pop-up experience seems to be that most of these organizations are internet-first operations, running either direct-to-consumer or without a physical presence. There are, however, many brands and organizations that have meaningful experience with these experiences. It seems to me that there must be a pattern behind what makes something successful (e.g. well-lit, good camera angles, static displays, sufficient space to avoid overcrowding, etc.) and that these patterns can be leveraged into a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this company takes the form of a consultancy or something closer to a “pop-up experience in a box” product, I don’t know. But I feel confident that as more brands work to foster an image and goodwill within the influencer and consumer space, somebody will start to act as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunities seem even greater when you consider the fact that retail spaces and malls across the country have suffered lower occupancy rates and difficulty leasing, and that many of these spaces are located in non-metropolitan areas. For the portion of the country that is not in a position to stumble into a brand-friendly Instagram situation, helping them along may provide a boost in the long tail of consumers across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A combination of trends in the branding world have converged such that there is an opportunity for a “pop-up experience in a box” company.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Future of Datasets</title><link href="http://www.andrewychoi.com/writing/2018/10/02/dataset-futures.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Future of Datasets" /><published>2018-10-02T11:23:45-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-02T11:23:45-04:00</updated><id>http://www.andrewychoi.com/writing/2018/10/02/dataset-futures</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.andrewychoi.com/writing/2018/10/02/dataset-futures.html">&lt;p&gt;Who’s getting value from your data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of new frameworks about how to think about data, and a number of them seem to capture a single dimension of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is the new oil
etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take this premise for granted that big tech firms have a monopolistic influence on the marketplace because of the network effect inherent in how they accumulate data. Taking a number of large tech firms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google: mapping data (Google Maps), search data (Google Search), and email data (Gmail), leveraged for advertisers,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Facebook: social graph data (friend requests), leveraged for advertisers,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instagram: social graph and interest graph data (follows), leveraged for advertisers,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whatsapp: social graph data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twitter: social graph and interest graph data (follows), leveraged for advertisers,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Snapchat: social graph data, leveraged for advertisers,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon: consumer buying intent data (main e-commerce site), leveraged for vendors, voice data (Alexa)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something to note about all of these datasets is that they come from products and services that are free to use for the end consumer, and are not used to make things actively better for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one example where the data that is being gathered is not being leveraged for the benefit of a third party:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Netflix: consumer entertainment interest data, leveraged for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple: voice data (Siri), smartphone usage data (iOS, App Store), and soon health (HealthKit, Apple Watch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been asserted a number of times that the most important value proposition of Apple has ceased to be hardware superiority or innovation in software or even the degree to which they can blend the two to achieve a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, and that the number one value prop for consumers is now privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the fights between the FBI and Apple to unlock iPhones and get at iMessage, consumers have been shown Apple’s willingness (or, more cynically, public posturing) to go to bat for their customers. As a result, consumers have little expectation that Apple will compromise them in other ways, such as surreptitiously selling HealthKit data to advertisers or healthcare insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the main thrust of first party efforts to sell products based on this data are not the only use case. At Predata, the utility of this data for industries other than advertising has always been our key motivator. The concept goes by different names in different areas (alternative data in finance, open-source data in the government) but the use case is the same: understand the world and its activity via a dataset that provides a unique viewpoint into the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort is only possible with the intersection of a couple of trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Predata, we watched internet ecosystem members begin to realize the value of their data, and start shifting to a less-open model. New social networks piggybacking off of existing follower networks became a threat model (see:  Instagram and Twitter, LinkedIn’s scraping battles) and correspondingly began to silo access to the richest parts of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As observers of that trend, we shifted our internal strategy from being able to roll up data sources whenever we wanted to, to examining ingestion costs not only from an engineering perspective (time, additional complexity of integration) to a line-of-business and cashflow perspective (can we externalize the cost of data acquisition or does this have to go on our own balance sheet?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, the feeling of “I know that I have a rational reason for not feeling this way, but I still do” is one that continues to frustrate decision making processes. I find that the reason why these things “ring hollow” is because I’m trying to answer an emotional objection with a logical answer, and there’s a disconnect between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a more general framework, I find that the concepts of logos, ethos, and pathos provide a great framework for evaluating why certain arguments in response to certain problems “ring hollow”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concepts are familiar to students of rhetoric, and are the linchpins of understanding arguments. As a refresher, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos&quot;&gt;Ethos&lt;/a&gt; is an appeal to the authority or credibility of the presenter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos&quot;&gt;Pathos&lt;/a&gt; is an appeal to the audience’s emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos&quot;&gt;Logos&lt;/a&gt; is logical appeal or the simulation of it…it is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker’s claims or thesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the metacognitive strategies that I use is to identify which of the three branches are being utilized in an objection or a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, if I have an objection that is based in pathos, but my response to it is logos-based (as in our example above) then it is not necessarily the best solution to find or invent a pathos-based response. Rather, metacognitively understanding that there is a disconnect between the two appeals while understanding that they speak to the same underlying issue sometimes can serve as enough to bridge the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts on the above-mentioned podcast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;scarcity-digitalcrypto-goods-vs-drm&quot;&gt;Scarcity: digital/crypto goods vs DRM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire time that Chris Dixon talks about the idea of crypto goods (to borrow the a16z term) enabling scarcity in digital environments, I was waiting for a mention of DRM. Aside from a brief mention that gets talked over by Wilson, there seems to be no serious discussion about the difference between the digital goods model vs. more traditional prior attempts at DRM. There’s a snippet where Wilson talks about replicability being the reason why a number of digital business models have failed, but it seems to me that DRM was previously touted as that solution in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the nuance is that the central question is not of ownership, but of consumption–even if the crypto space provides an unambiguous record of who owns a specific song, what prevents other people from enjoying that song? The value for the consumer of a piece of music or art or movie is not that I have title to the work (because in some real sense I do not–the actual piece of music or movie is generally owned by a third party!) but whether or not I have the ability to enjoy it on demand. What is the value of digital goods (if not in resale) otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;traditional-economist-objection-to-cryptocurrencies&quot;&gt;“Traditional” economist objection to cryptocurrencies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Dixon make the simplifying assumption that there are a large number of traditional economists who have written off the fundamental value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because “at the end of the day, they’re just electronic bytes”. This serves as a catalyst for a great discussion about the primacy of commerce vs. e-commerce, sports vs. e-sports, which resonated with me. However, the view that I hold wrt the fundamental value of cryptocurrencies is that there is no physical power that has a vested interest in the continuation of the monetary fiction. To paraphrase, how many legions has Bitcoin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;digital-natives&quot;&gt;Digital natives&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point that gets made is that the innovation in digital goods is spreading faster in the gaming arena than in other areas. There’s also another interesting corollary here, which is that there were a number of communities that have adopted these goods before even US gamers have (wrt Fornite et al). Line, lest we forget, became a contender in the messaging space due to a domination of Japanese online communication, and the reason why it was throwing off so much cash was due to online stickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would seem to be a point in favor of the thesis that we’re converging recently on a normalization of the digital goods paradigm for the digital natives. The question that one then asks is if we believe that either a) the older generations will adapt to that mental model, or b) if the demographic shift will be rapid enough for these models to become the most important modality of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a question of adoption, I suspect that (at least) millennials will be resistant to this idea of living as digital-first and digital-only. There’s already a tremendous industry focused on wellness, and it’s mature enough that we see features from major industry players (Apple in iOS, Google in Android) to help focus on things like screen time and (one suspects) to help minimize it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">a16z podcast here.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What’s next in advertising?</title><link href="http://www.andrewychoi.com/writing/2018/06/11/advertising-trends.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What's next in advertising?" /><published>2018-06-11T11:23:45-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-11T11:23:45-04:00</updated><id>http://www.andrewychoi.com/writing/2018/06/11/advertising-trends</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.andrewychoi.com/writing/2018/06/11/advertising-trends.html">&lt;p&gt;The history of advertising is shaped by the channels that are available to the advertisers and the engagement that is possible within them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadcast media began with engagement-less models–originally, all advertising must have been impression focused!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the idea of a call-in occurred: the consumer could now reach back out to an advertiser and ask about a specific offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an imperfect answer to “How many people did this reach?”, so now we have companies like Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct mail ads represent a big step forward in terms of targeting: now, with an address, you could potentially have an idea of who exactly you’re targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet advertising now takes this to an increasingly personal level. Clickthrough rates allow users to engage and convert into revenue for an advertiser more quickly than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of all these impressions is to build an image of a brand for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more that consumers identify with a brand, the more successful it will be. These days, our identies are curated and presented on a pedestal on social media–Instagram being the biggest culprit. The amount of stimulation that images bring compared to text is responsible for the way that consumers viscerally react to properties like Instagram and Pinterest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do consumers add content to their own visual story? They go out into the world and do things. They tie themselves directly to the images that they experience in the world. The “Instagramification” of food has been covered in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16000552/instagram-restaurant-interior-design-photo-friendly-media-noche&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2017/7/6/15925940/instagram-influencers-cronuts-milkshakes-burgers&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt;, and even for people who are opposed to it, they are feeling an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/while-we-were-young&quot;&gt;urge to engage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective form of this branding is the pop-up. By imposing a time limit on the availability of the experience (and correspondingly, of the claim to have enjoyed it) the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why haven’t we seen a wholesale embrace of the physical store/pop-up experience from existing brands? Consumer packaged goods behemoths have been paying top dollar for these startup brands (e.g. Dollar Shave Club) and yet seem unable to create these brands for themselves in-house. It seems difficult to ask a large corporation to pivot an existing brand to tackle this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the model that should exist is a sort of “labs” effort? New brands are incubated in house and spun out with controlling stakes once they find traction. Given the high cost of establishing a retail presence (even in a pop-up scenario) existing companies should have a leg up in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea was to do a conditional JavaScript import, but the problem actually ended up being in the Django template syntax.  The correction was to replace the “else if” with an “elif”.  Rookie mistake!
Corrected code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% if display_type == 'ts' %}
&amp;lt;script src=&quot;/static/highstock.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
{% elif display_type == 'avg' %}
&amp;lt;script src=&quot;/static/highcharts.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
{% endif %}

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a continuation statement for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt; loop, make sure to use user-defined variables (i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DECLARE foo INT DEFAULT 10&lt;/code&gt; as opposed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SET @foo = 10&lt;/code&gt;, which defines a session variable called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@foo&lt;/code&gt; to be 10)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When using these user-defined variables, be sure to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DECLARE&lt;/code&gt; them before any other code gets executed. I’m embarrassed to say that this is one of the things that confounded me the most, despite having written more lines in C than in probably any other language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
