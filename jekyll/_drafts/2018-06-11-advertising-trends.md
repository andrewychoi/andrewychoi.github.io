The history of advertising is shaped by the channels that are available to the advertisers and the engagement that is possible within them.

Broadcast media began with engagement-less models--originally, all advertising must have been impression focused!

Then the idea of a call-in occurred: the consumer could now reach back out to an advertiser and ask about a specific offering.

This is an imperfect answer to "How many people did this reach?", so now we have companies like Nielsen.

Direct mail ads represent a big step forward in terms of targeting: now, with an address, you could potentially have an idea of who exactly you're targeting.

Internet advertising now takes this to an increasingly personal level. Clickthrough rates allow users to engage and convert into revenue for an advertiser more quickly than ever before.

The point of all these impressions is to build an image of a brand for people.

The more that consumers identify with a brand, the more successful it will be. These days, our identies are curated and presented on a pedestal on social media--Instagram being the biggest culprit. The amount of stimulation that images bring compared to text is responsible for the way that consumers viscerally react to properties like Instagram and Pinterest.

How do consumers add content to their own visual story? They go out into the world and do things. They tie themselves directly to the images that they experience in the world.

The most effective form of this branding is the pop-up. By imposing a time limit on the availability of the experience (and correspondingly, of the claim to have enjoyed it) the

So why haven't we seen a wholesale embrace of the physical store/pop-up experience from existing brands? Consumer packaged goods behemoths have been paying top dollar for these startup brands (e.g. Dollar Shave Club) and yet seem unable to create these brands for themselves in-house. It seems difficult to ask a large corporation to pivot an existing brand to tackle this.

Perhaps the model that should exist is a sort of "labs" effort? New brands are incubated in house and spun out with controlling stakes once they find traction. Given the high cost of establishing a retail presence (even in a pop-up scenario) existing companies should have a leg up in this regard.
