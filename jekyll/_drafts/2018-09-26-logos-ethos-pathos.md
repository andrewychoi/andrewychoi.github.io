Ontology - Issues are raised by objections and pacified by responses

For many people, the feeling of "I know that I have a rational reason for not feeling this way, but I still do" is one that continues to frustrate decision making processes. I find that the reason why these things "ring hollow" is because I'm trying to answer an emotional objection with a logical answer, and there's a disconnect between the two.

As a more general framework, I find that the concepts of logos, ethos, and pathos provide a great framework for evaluating why certain arguments in response to certain problems "ring hollow".

These concepts are familiar to students of rhetoric, and are the linchpins of understanding arguments. As a refresher, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion):

- [Ethos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos) is an appeal to the authority or credibility of the presenter.
- [Pathos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos) is an appeal to the audienceâ€™s emotions. 
- [Logos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos) is logical appeal or the simulation of it...it is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's claims or thesis.

One of the metacognitive strategies that I use is to identify which of the three branches are being utilized in an objection or a response.

Importantly, if I have an objection that is based in pathos, but my response to it is logos-based (as in our example above) then it is not necessarily the best solution to find or invent a pathos-based response. Rather, metacognitively understanding that there is a disconnect between the two appeals while understanding that they speak to the same underlying issue sometimes can serve as enough to bridge the gap.
