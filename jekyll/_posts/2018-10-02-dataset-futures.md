Who's getting value from your data?

There are a number of new frameworks about how to think about data, and a number of them seem to capture a single dimension of the problem:

Data is the new oil
etc.

We take this premise for granted that big tech firms have a monopolistic influence on the marketplace because of the network effect inherent in how they accumulate data. Taking a number of large tech firms:
- Google: mapping data (Google Maps), search data (Google Search), and email data (Gmail), leveraged for advertisers,
- Facebook: social graph data (friend requests), leveraged for advertisers,
- Instagram: social graph and interest graph data (follows), leveraged for advertisers,
- Whatsapp: social graph data
- Twitter: social graph and interest graph data (follows), leveraged for advertisers,
- Snapchat: social graph data, leveraged for advertisers,
- Amazon: consumer buying intent data (main e-commerce site), leveraged for vendors, voice data (Alexa)

Something to note about all of these datasets is that they come from products and services that are free to use for the end consumer, and are not used to make things actively better for consumers.

There is one example where the data that is being gathered is not being leveraged for the benefit of a third party:
- Netflix: consumer entertainment interest data, leveraged for 
- Apple: voice data (Siri), smartphone usage data (iOS, App Store), and soon health (HealthKit, Apple Watch)

It's been asserted a number of times that the most important value proposition of Apple has ceased to be hardware superiority or innovation in software or even the degree to which they can blend the two to achieve a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, and that the number one value prop for consumers is now privacy.

After the fights between the FBI and Apple to unlock iPhones and get at iMessage, consumers have been shown Apple's willingness (or, more cynically, public posturing) to go to bat for their customers. As a result, consumers have little expectation that Apple will compromise them in other ways, such as surreptitiously selling HealthKit data to advertisers or healthcare insurers.

However, the main thrust of first party efforts to sell products based on this data are not the only use case. At Predata, the utility of this data for industries other than advertising has always been our key motivator. The concept goes by different names in different areas (alternative data in finance, open-source data in the government) but the use case is the same: understand the world and its activity via a dataset that provides a unique viewpoint into the world.

This effort is only possible with the intersection of a couple of trends.

At Predata, we watched internet ecosystem members begin to realize the value of their data, and start shifting to a less-open model. New social networks piggybacking off of existing follower networks became a threat model (see:  Instagram and Twitter, LinkedIn's scraping battles) and correspondingly began to silo access to the richest parts of data.

As observers of that trend, we shifted our internal strategy from being able to roll up data sources whenever we wanted to, to examining ingestion costs not only from an engineering perspective (time, additional complexity of integration) to a line-of-business and cashflow perspective (can we externalize the cost of data acquisition or does this have to go on our own balance sheet?).
